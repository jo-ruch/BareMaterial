#BareMaterial
<!--*Front-end framework*-->

Yes, I know there are a lot of good Material Design based frameworks out there, but most are way to complicated.
This framework focuses on simplicity. 

Not all Material Design features are included but I will try to add more.

##Included
**Basics** 
- Normalization
- Metrics
- Colors
- Fonts
- Icons

**Components**
- Toolbar
- Cards
- Forms
- Menu
- Loaders
- Tables
- Buttons

##How to use
Put your custom scss in template.scss. This file will generate the final barematerial.css.

You can include core components in the scss/barematerial.scss file or exclude them if you dont want to use them to keep your css clean.
